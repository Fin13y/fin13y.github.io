          Green Sprout Seedlings started in 2020 when we realized our community needed a reliable source for quality, locally-grown seedlings. What began as a backyard greenhouse operation has grown into a trusted resource for gardeners throughout our area.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're a small, family-run business with a big passion for plants. Every seedling we sell is grown with care in our local greenhouses, ensuring they're perfectly adapted to our regional climate. We believe that successful gardening starts with healthy plants and good advice - and we're committed to providing both.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we've served thousands of home gardeners, from first-time planters to experienced growers. We've watched backyard gardens flourish, community plots thrive, and a new generation discover the joy of growing their own food. That's what keeps us going - knowing that we're part of something bigger than just selling plants.

        <h2>How We Grow Your Seedlings</h2>
        <p>
          We take pride in our growing methods. All our seedlings start from quality seeds, many sourced from organic and heirloom suppliers. We use a nutrient-rich, peat-free potting mix that gives young plants a strong foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our greenhouses are carefully monitored for temperature, humidity, and light to ensure optimal growing conditions. We practice integrated pest management, avoiding harsh chemicals whenever possible. Many of our varieties are certified organic or grown using organic methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before any seedling goes to a customer, it's hardened off - gradually acclimated to outdoor conditions so it transplants successfully into your garden. We include growing instructions with every purchase and are always available to answer questions.
