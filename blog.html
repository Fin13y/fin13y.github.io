          <h2>The Perfect Time to Transplant Seedlings</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most common questions we hear is "When should I transplant my seedlings outdoors?" The answer depends on several factors, but here's what you need to know to get it right.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Watch the Weather:</strong> The key is waiting until after your last frost date. In our area, that's typically mid to late April, but Mother Nature doesn't always follow the calendar. Check your local forecast and be prepared to cover plants if a late frost threatens.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Harden Off First:</strong> Before transplanting, gradually acclimate your seedlings to outdoor conditions over 7-10 days. Start with a few hours of morning sun and protected conditions, slowly increasing exposure to sun and wind. This crucial step prevents transplant shock.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Soil Temperature Matters:</strong> Warm-season crops like tomatoes and peppers need soil temperatures of at least 60°F (ideally 65-70°F) to thrive. Cool-season crops like lettuce and kale can handle cooler soil. A simple soil thermometer takes the guesswork out.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Timing Your Transplant:</strong> Transplant on a cloudy day or in the evening to reduce stress. Water thoroughly before and after transplanting. Expect a brief period where plants look a bit sad - that's normal as they adjust.
          </p>
          <p>

          <h2>Growing Amazing Tomatoes: Our Top 5 Tips</h2>
          <p>
            Tomatoes are the star of the summer garden, but they can be tricky. After years of growing thousands of tomato plants, here are our proven tips for success.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1. Start with Healthy Seedlings:</strong> Strong, stocky plants with deep green leaves establish faster and produce better. Avoid leggy, pale seedlings - they'll struggle all season. Our seedlings are grown slowly in optimal conditions to give you that strong start.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Plant Deep:</strong> Tomatoes develop roots along their buried stem. Remove lower leaves and plant deep - up to the first set of true leaves. This creates a robust root system that supports heavy fruit production.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3. Provide Consistent Water:</strong> Inconsistent watering causes blossom end rot and cracked fruit. Aim for 1-2 inches per week from rain or irrigation. Mulch helps maintain even soil moisture and suppresses weeds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>4. Support Early:</strong> Install cages or stakes at planting time. It's much harder to do later without damaging plants. Determinate varieties do well in cages; indeterminate varieties often prefer sturdy stakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>5. Feed Appropriately:</strong> Too much nitrogen creates lush foliage with few tomatoes. Use a balanced fertilizer at planting, then switch to a lower nitrogen formula (like 5-10-10) once flowering begins. Compost is always a great choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stop by for our tomato seedlings starting in mid-April. We'll have heirloom and hybrid varieties, each labeled with specific growing information.

          <h2>Container Gardening: Perfect for Small Spaces</h2>
          <p>
            Don't have space for a traditional garden? No problem! Container gardening lets you grow amazing produce on patios, balconies, and even sunny windowsills.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Choose the Right Size:</strong> Bigger is generally better. Tomatoes and peppers need at least 5-gallon containers (12-14 inches diameter). Herbs can thrive in smaller pots. Lettuce and greens do well in wide, shallow containers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Drainage is Critical:</strong> Containers must have drainage holes - no exceptions. Sitting in water causes root rot. Elevate pots slightly with pot feet or bricks to ensure good drainage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Use Quality Potting Mix:</strong> Never use garden soil in containers - it compacts and drains poorly. Use a quality potting mix specifically designed for containers. It's lighter, drains well, and provides good air circulation to roots.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Water Consistently:</strong> Containers dry out faster than garden beds. During hot weather, you may need to water daily. Check soil moisture by sticking your finger in 2 inches - if it's dry, water thoroughly until it drains from the bottom.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Feed Regularly:</strong> Frequent watering washes nutrients from potting mix. Use a diluted liquid fertilizer every 2-3 weeks, or mix slow-release fertilizer into your potting mix at planting time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Best Container Crops:</strong> Tomatoes (especially cherry varieties), peppers, lettuce, herbs, radishes, and green onions are all excellent container choices. Come see our selection and get specific recommendations for your space and conditions.

          <h2>Natural Pest Control for Organic Gardens</h2>
          <p>
            Managing pests without harsh chemicals is easier than you think. Here are our favorite organic approaches that really work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Prevention First:</strong> Healthy plants resist pests better. Proper spacing, good soil, adequate water, and choosing disease-resistant varieties create naturally resilient gardens. This is always your first line of defense.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Companion Planting:</strong> Marigolds near tomatoes deter aphids. Basil planted with peppers confuses pest insects. Nasturtiums act as a trap crop, attracting aphids away from other plants. These traditional techniques really do help.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Hand Picking:</strong> For larger pests like tomato hornworms and cabbage worms, hand picking is effective. Check plants in the morning when caterpillars are less active. Drop them in soapy water.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Physical Barriers:</strong> Row covers protect young plants from flying insects and beetles. Remove them when plants flower and need pollinator access. Copper tape around pots deters slugs and snails.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Beneficial Insects:</strong> Ladybugs, lacewings, and predatory wasps eat common garden pests. Attract them by planting flowers like alyssum, yarrow, and dill. Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that kill beneficials along with pests.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Organic Sprays:</strong> When necessary, insecticidal soap, neem oil, and BT (Bacillus thuringiensis) control many common pests with minimal environmental impact. Always follow label directions and spray in evening to protect pollinators.
          </p>
          <p>

          <h2>Succession Planting for Continuous Harvests</h2>
          <p>
            Want fresh salads all season instead of one big harvest? Succession planting is the answer. Here's how to keep the harvests coming.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What is Succession Planting?</strong> Instead of planting all your lettuce, beans, or radishes at once, you plant small amounts every 2-3 weeks throughout the growing season. This gives you continuous small harvests instead of a glut followed by nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Best Crops for Succession:</strong> Lettuce, spinach, radishes, beans, peas, carrots, and beets all work beautifully with succession planting. These crops mature relatively quickly and tolerate being planted multiple times per season.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Timing Your Plantings:</strong> For spring crops like lettuce and spinach, start 4-6 weeks before your last frost, then plant more every 2 weeks until temperatures get too hot (usually late May here). Resume in late summer for fall crops.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Planning Your Space:</strong> You don't need a lot of room. A 4-foot row of lettuce every two weeks provides steady salads for a family. Mark your calendar or set phone reminders so you don't forget to plant the next succession.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Season Extension:</strong> Use shade cloth in summer to extend cool-season crops like lettuce. In fall, row covers or cold frames protect plants from light frosts, extending your harvest season by weeks.
          </p>
          <p>
            We keep quick-maturing varieties like lettuce and radish seedlings in stock throughout the spring and fall specifically for succession planting. Stop by every couple of weeks to keep your harvests coming!
